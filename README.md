# Elite Dangerous - Road to Riches

This is just a private application that I made to make things easier while doing Road to Riches exploration. I parse the route from 
http://edtools.ddns.net/expl.php
and use the game made Journals.

# The point of this whole thing

While doing exploration and using edtools website it gets very annoying to check which system you have entered. The website does
give you checkbox but making that automatic might make it less painful.
